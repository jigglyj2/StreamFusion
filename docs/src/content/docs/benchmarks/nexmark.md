title: Nexmark benchmarks
description: The north-star Kafka-in/Kafka-out comparison.
---

The north-star benchmark compares StreamFusion with native Flink using the Nexmark streaming workload. Both engines consume the same officially generated Nexmark events from Kafka and write results back to Kafka with exactly-once delivery.

## Benchmark matrix

| State backend | Mini-batching |
| --- | --- |
| In-memory hash map | Off |
| In-memory hash map | On |
| RocksDB | Off |
| RocksDB | On |

Each case reports input-record throughput for native Flink and StreamFusion. Optimization work must keep the implementation simple and remain close to Flink's architecture while preserving result parity.

## Query suite

SQL definitions live in `streamfusion-nexmark-benchmarks/src/main/resources/nexmark/queries`. The suite tracks the queries supported by the targeted Flink release, including queries that produce updating results and therefore require an upsert-capable Kafka sink.

## Code-owned integration

The integration command provisions Kafka with Testcontainers, generates official Nexmark events, invokes both engines, reads only committed output, validates the result, and renders a throughput table. This keeps broker setup, workload generation, execution, and measurement in one reproducible path.

Run the Docker-backed integration profile with:

```shell
mvn -pl streamfusion-nexmark-benchmarks -am -Pbenchmark-integration verify
```
